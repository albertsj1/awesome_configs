* Notes
  - The rc.lua file is a complete mess, but it works.  I'll clean it
    up when I have time.
* Caveats
  - It works for me on Ubuntu 10.04 with the available awesome
    packages. It may not work for you. :)
* Requirements
  - The file ~/tmp/gmail and ~/tmp/email must exist for the email
    check to work.
  - You must create a file called
    ~/.config/awesome/scripts/mypasswords.py and put the following in
    it:
      global email_password
      global gmail_password

      email_password="<your email password>"
      gmail_password="<your gmail password>"
  - Change the email server host and port appropriately in
    ~/.config/awesome/scripts/unread-email.py
